# 🎲 Dice Game

A simple and fun dice game where two players roll dice, and the one with the higher number wins! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project allows users to enter their names once, and then simply roll the dice with a button click.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎭 Enter player names only once (saved in session storage)
- 🎲 Random dice rolls on each refresh
- 🏆 Displays the winner dynamically
- 🎨 Clean and modern UI with a floating control panel
- 🔄 "Roll the Dice" button for quick replays

## 🎮 How to Play

## 💡 Session Storage Usage

I didn't know much about session storage initially, so I used GPT's help to implement it. This feature allows player names to persist across refreshes without requiring re-entry.
